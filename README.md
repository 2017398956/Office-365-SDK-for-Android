## Overview ##

With the Office 365 SDK for Android Preview, itâ€™s now possible to use data stored in Microsoft Office 365 from your Android Apps. This means, you can access SharePoint lists, folders or Exchange calendar, contacts and emails from within your Android-based applications. 

[Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc. (MS Open Tech)](http://msopentech.com) has built the **Office 365 SDK for Android Preview**, an open source project that strives to help Android developers access Office 365 data from their apps.

This SDK provides access to: Microsoft SharePoint Lists, Microsoft SharePoint Files, Microsoft Exchange Calendar, Microsoft Exchange Contacts, Microsoft Exchange Mail.

##Build instructions

Office 365 Android SDK uses Apache Olingo (http://olingo.apache.org/) to handle all things OData V4 and must be installed in your local maven repository (/.m2). This extra step is required since Olingo OData V4 has not been released yet. 

In the future, this step won't be required and will be handled by Maven as another dependency.
To deploy Olingo into your local Maven repository simply:

```
git clone https://github.com/apache/olingo-odata4.git
mvn clean install
``` 
After successfully builded and installed, please proceed to build *mail-calendar-contact SDK*

```
git clone https://github.com/MSOpenTech/O365-Android.git
cd /sdk/office365-mail-calendar-contact-sdk
mvn clean install
```


##Office 365 Samples

We've created a sample to use as starting point to develop android application using all the new set of SDKs Office 365 provides. In order to make it even simpler, we propose two different approaches depending on your needs and preferences.

The first (and simpler) one, uses Android Studio and Maven archetypes to generate the sample and download its dependencies. The other approach, uses eclipse and download the code and dependencies manually.

##Simple Office 365 Sample

The application is a really simple android sample, with all the dependencies and code needed to obtain an authentication token using ADAL libraries.

It is composed by an activity where to display the obtained token and a view to set some information needed to authenticate (client id, return url, and resource url)

###Using Maven archetypes

We've created an archetype that creates a new android application with ADAL as dependency. In order to use it, you will need to have installed and configured Maven and Android Studio.

####Prerequisites

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) 
- [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) - This sample was tested with Maven v3.2.3 

1- Install the archetype in your local repository. To do this, clone the archetype's git repository: 

```
git clone https://github.com/MSOpenTech/O365-Android.git
```

2- Open a console in the samples/android-quickstart folder within the downloaded repository and run the maven command to install the archetype
	
```
mvn clean install
```

>Note: If asked for archetype version, use 0.1.0 as this is the current version.

3- Now that the archetype is installed, generate the sample by running the following command:

```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=office365-quickstart -DarchetypeGroupId=com.microsoft.office365 ^
-DarchetypeVersion=0.1.0 -DgroupId=[YOUR-GROUP-ID] ^
-DartifactId=[YOUR-ARTIFACT-ID]
```

4- In Android Studio, open the generated code and start the application.

5- Open preferences view and set your client id, the redirect url and the resource url (for more information about this, go to Azure Active Directory Library for Android [site](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android)). 

6- Click get token. A login view will appear, enter your credentials. 

7- Your token will appear in the screen.

Now you are able to start using any of the Office 365 SDKs to create your own projects.

###Using Eclipse

####Prerequisites

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/home/index.php)
- [ADT Plugin](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/eclipse-adt.html)

In order to start the sample an application using eclipse, you will first need to clone Office 365 and ADAL repositories.

1- Go to Microsoft Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) [site](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android) and follow the instructions to download and configure the library.

```
git clone https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-android.git
```

2- Clone Office 365 SDK repository

```
git clone https://github.com/MSOpenTech/O365-Android.git
```

3- In Samples folder, open hello-android sample using eclipse.

4- Import the ADAL project you downloaded in the previous steps.

5- Update the sample to use ADAL by adding a reference to ADAL project from Properties | Android | Library.

>Note: You might have compiling errors due to the android support library's version shipped with ADAL. Please make sure you're using the same version in both projects.

## Features ##
For the entire list of methods available in the SDK, please refer to the java docs under each SDK in the SDK folder.

## Tests ##

Apart from the sample apps, we also have end to end tests that demonstrate the use of the SDK. Please look at the tests folder under the root of the SDK.
